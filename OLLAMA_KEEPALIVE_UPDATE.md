# 🔧 Ollama Keep-Alive Parameter Update

## ✅ Update Complete

The Ollama `keep_alive` parameter has been successfully updated from the default 5 minutes to **30 minutes** across all API calls in the video generation pipeline.

## 📋 Changes Made

### **1. MixtralClient (`mixtral_client.py`)**
Updated the `_call_mixtral()` function to include `keep_alive: "30m"`:

```python
payload = {
    "model": self.model,
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}
    ],
    "stream": False,
    "keep_alive": "30m",  # ← ADDED: 30-minute keep-alive
    "options": {
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "top_p": 0.9,
        "max_tokens": 500
    }
}
```

### **2. FinalEnhancedGenerator (`final_enhanced_generator.py`)**
Updated the Mixtral transition prompt generation to include `keep_alive: "30m"`:

```python
response = requests.post(
    f"{self.mixtral_url}/api/generate",
    json={
        "model": "mixtral",
        "prompt": transition_prompt,
        "stream": False,
        "keep_alive": "30m",  # ← ADDED: 30-minute keep-alive
        "options": {"temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.9}
    },
    timeout=20
)
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### **Performance Improvements:**
- **⚡ Faster Response Times**: Models stay loaded in memory for 30 minutes
- **🔄 Better User Experience**: Reduced wait times for subsequent requests
- **💾 Memory Efficiency**: Models don't reload as frequently

### **Use Cases That Benefit:**
- **Enhanced Video Generation**: Multiple Mixtral calls for transition prompts
- **Character Consistency**: Multiple prompts for character profile generation  
- **Scene Analysis**: Sequential scene planning with narrative structure
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple video generations in sequence

## 🧪 Testing Results

All tests **PASSED** successfully:

### ✅ **Code Verification**: 
- `keep_alive: "30m"` parameter present in both files
- Correct API endpoint usage

### ✅ **MixtralClient Test**:
- Successfully connected to Ollama
- Generated response with 30-minute keep-alive
- Confirmed parameter functionality

### ✅ **EnhancedGenerator Test**:
- Generated 5 transition prompts successfully
- All prompts received with keep-alive active
- Integration working properly

## 📊 Impact on Video Generation Pipeline

### **Before (5-minute keep-alive):**
- Model unloaded after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Each video generation could trigger model reload
- Slower response times for subsequent requests

### **After (30-minute keep-alive):**
- Model stays loaded for 30 minutes
- Multiple video generations use cached model
- Consistent fast response times
- Better user experience during active sessions

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **API Endpoints Updated:**
1. **`/api/chat`** - Main Mixtral conversation endpoint (MixtralClient)
2. **`/api/generate`** - Simple generation endpoint (FinalEnhancedGenerator)

### **Not Updated:**
- **`/api/tags`** - Connection check endpoint (doesn't need keep-alive)
- **Stable Diffusion APIs** - Not Ollama-based

### **Keep-Alive Format:**
- **Value**: `"30m"` (30 minutes)
- **Alternative formats**: `"1800s"` (seconds) or `"0.5h"` (hours)

## 🎉 Summary

The Ollama keep-alive parameter has been successfully updated to 30 minutes, providing:

- **6x longer model retention** (30 minutes vs 5 minutes)
- **Improved performance** for enhanced video generation
- **Better user experience** during active video generation sessions
- **Reduced model loading overhead** for sequential requests

All components tested and working properly! 🚀
