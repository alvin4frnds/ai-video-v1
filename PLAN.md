# AI Video Generation Project Plan

## Project Overview
Developing an AI-powered video generation system that converts text prompts into videos through scene-based generation.

## Workflow Pipeline
1. **Text Prompt Analysis** - Parse and understand input text
2. **Scene Sequencing** - Break down into logical still frame sequences  
3. **Image Generation** - Create AI-generated images for each still frame
4. **Transition Creation** - Generate smooth video transitions between scenes

## Technical Architecture
- Prompt analyzer module
- Scene planning engine
- Image generation interface (AI models)
- Video transition generator
- Main orchestration pipeline

## Goals
- Convert text descriptions to coherent video sequences
- Generate high-quality still frames for key scenes
- Create smooth transitions between different scenes
- Support various narrative styles and visual themes

## Implementation Steps
1. Design text prompt analysis system
2. Create scene sequence planning module
3. Implement image generation for still frames
4. Build transition video creation system
5. Integrate all components into main pipeline

## Notes
- Focus on creating logical scene progressions
- Ensure visual consistency across generated frames
- Optimize for smooth narrative flow
