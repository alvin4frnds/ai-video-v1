# AI Video Generation Project - Context & Command History
# Last Updated: 2025-07-19

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
- AI-powered video generation system that converts text prompts into videos
- 4-step pipeline: Text Analysis → Scene Sequencing → Image Generation → Video Transitions
- Built with Gradio UI for interactive interface with progress tracking and live logs

## COMMAND HISTORY & DECISIONS

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Command: "initialize git project, we will be working on video generation today using AI models. remember to commit everything you change"
   - Action: Created git repo, initial README.md, first commit

2. **Plan Documentation**
   - Command: "okay the plan is, not it somewhere"
   - Action: Created PLAN.md with project overview and goals

3. **Core Architecture Design** 
   - Command: "i will give a text prompt in input, it should first analyze the input, then it should idealize a sequence of stills required, then we will generate the images for different still frames, then create the transition video from going to 1 scene to next"
   - Action: Updated PLAN.md with detailed 4-step workflow pipeline

4. **UI & Progress Requirements**
   - Command: "you can use gradio to create a simple UI, as well as show me the progress, stills and prompts for each image, if you can create a progress bar, and since i am bit nerdy i need linux type logs running through"
   - Action: Created comprehensive Gradio interface with:
     * Progress bars and real-time status updates
     * Linux-style live log streaming
     * Still frame preview gallery
     * Video output display
     * Interactive prompt input

5. **Environment Setup**
   - Command: "create and use a conda environment"
   - Action: Created conda environment with PyTorch, CUDA support, Gradio
   - Files: environment.yml, run.sh script

6. **Port Configuration**
   - Command: "change port to 8003"
   - Action: Updated Gradio server port from 7860 to 8003

7. **Bug Fix**
   - Issue: TypeError with Gradio 'every' parameter
   - Action: Fixed deprecated syntax, replaced with gr.Timer


1. **Context file creation**
   - Action: Created context.txt and automatic update system


1. **Add Mixtral LLM model**
   - Action: Integrated Mixtral for intelligent scene analysis and prompt enhancement


1. **Integrate Automatic1111 SD WebUI**
   - Action: Added real image generation with Stable Diffusion API integration


1. **Update SD settings**
   - Action: Applied custom settings: DPM++ 2M SDE Karras, CFG 7, 512x768, 50 steps, cyberrealistic model


1. **Configure network SD WebUI**
   - Action: Updated SD client to use network IP 192.168.0.199:8001, tested API connection successfully


1. **Add random test prompt feature**
   - Action: Added auto-generation of test prompts when input is empty, with random color/location combinations

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
✅ Git repository initialized
✅ Project plan documented
✅ Gradio UI with progress tracking
✅ Linux-style log display
✅ 4-step video generation pipeline
✅ Conda environment setup
✅ Still frame preview gallery
✅ Port configured to 8003
✅ Bug fixes applied

✅ Context tracking system implemented

## CURRENT WORKFLOW
1. **Text Prompt Analysis** - Parse narrative structure, identify scenes
2. **Scene Sequencing** - Plan still frame sequences with timing
3. **Image Generation** - Create AI images for each scene (placeholder implementation)
4. **Video Creation** - Generate video with transitions between stills

## NEXT STEPS & POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS
- Replace placeholder image generation with real AI models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E)
- Add more transition effects beyond fade
- Implement video style controls
- Add audio generation capabilities
- Optimize performance for longer sequences

## CONFIGURATION
- Server: localhost:8003
- Environment: conda environment 'video-generation'
- Launch: ./run.sh
- Dependencies: PyTorch, Gradio, OpenCV, Diffusers, Transformers
